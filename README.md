# Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) Guide

## Overview

**Windows Communication Foundation (WCF)** is a **legacy** technology primarily used for **service-oriented applications** in .NET Framework. While WCF is **not supported in .NET 5 and later**, it is still widely used in **many existing enterprise applications**. Due to its continued presence in the market, I created this repository as an **introduction and recap** for anyone needing to understand, maintain, or migrate WCF services.

This guide covers WCF fundamentals, security, hosting, error handling, and modern alternatives, ensuring developers have a comprehensive reference for working with WCF or transitioning to newer technologies.
